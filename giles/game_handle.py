"""
game_handle.py: Control object for a particular game implementation.

GameHandles are meant to be the method by which new instances of games
('tables', in Giles-speak) are instantiated and how game implementations
themselves are reloaded on-the-fly.  In addition, they currently have a
very basic ACL implementation; games can optionally be instantiated only
by admins.  This is meant for both testing and for long-term games where
only one or two instances are meant to be running at the same time.
